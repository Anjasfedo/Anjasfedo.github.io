## Overview

This project is a comprehensive AI content generation platform. By leveraging **GPT-4**, we allow users to transform simple prompts into professional-grade marketing copy.

> ### The Mission
>
> To bridge the gap between complex AI capabilities and intuitive user workflows.

## Key Features

- **Custom Fine-tuning**: Train models on your own data.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Built with WebSockets and CRDTs.

```typescript
// Example of our streaming implementation
const streamResponse = async (prompt: string) => {
  const response = await ai.generate(prompt);
  return response.stream();
};
```
